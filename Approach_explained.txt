I have used 2 layer LSTM network

Network Architecture: Keras Framework used

1.Embedding layer
2.Conv1D
3.MaxPooling1D
4.LSTM_1
5.LSTM_2 with Dropout
6.Dense

Note:
	1. I have restricted my vocabulary to 15441 words , with stopwords and non-alpha characters
removed.
	2. I have used Stochastic Weight Averaging to ensure more test accuracy.
	3. I have cosine annealing learning rate to help with the weights training.
